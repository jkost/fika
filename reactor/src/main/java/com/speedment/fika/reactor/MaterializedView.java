/**
 * A materialized view holds a snapshot of the current state of a table in the
 * database. The table rows are considered events that refer to entities. If 
 * multiple events refer to the same entity, the entities willbe merged into the 
 * state so that each entity only exist once. This is useful to create an Event 
 * Sourcing system from a regular relational database.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example usage:</b>
 * <code>
 *      final MaterializedView&lt;ArticleEvent&gt; articlesView 
 *          = new MaterializedView&lt;&gt;(ArticleEvent.ARTICLE_ID);
 *

 *                  ArticleEvent.ARTICLE_ID
 *          ).withListener(articlesView).build();
 * 
 *      // The reactor is automatically started.
